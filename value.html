				It all started with a simple question, “Why are so many Maritime and Offshore Oil companies routinely faced with financial setbacks after an optimistic start to a project?”  Having worked in the maritime industry, we saw the tremendous frustration that came from programs that had little foresight and were managed through the day to day reaction to problems.  In the shipbuilding industry alone, think of all the projects that have been termed a “catastrophic success”—a successfully complete project that endured massive cost overruns and schedule delays. We also witnessed the celebration and success of projects that were the result of proactive and positive Risk Management programs.  We really believe that the companies who operate in our industry can be greatly improved through our main focus—effective Risk Management.</p>
                <p>
DCT exists at the intersection of financial objectives and cost and liability control.  We work with companies to amplify what they are already doing and strengthen their risk management approach.  Through this process, we strengthen your organization and change the way you approach projects.  </p>
                <p>
We understand that Risk Management issues are complex and require experience and focus.  We pride ourselves on creating value by controlling costs and mitigating risks, both which make your financial standing look good and your company a better run organization.
