                <p><b><i>We believe the reasons why we do business are just as important as what we do and how we do it.  Clients look to us to protect their financial investments and business’ well-being. </i></b> </p>

                <p>
<b>Our Focus:</b> We focus solely on the Maritime, Port and Offshore Oil Industry.  Many larger, well-known consulting firms have outlaying divisions that serve the maritime and offshore oil industry, but these groups often lack the knowledge and experience necessary to effectively serve these unique industries.  
                    </p>
                <p>
<b>Our Value:</b> DCT creates value by protecting our clients from risk exposure, mitigating the effects of risks after they occur, and monitoring and controlling risks in parallel with our client business objectives.  We provide innovative cost avoidance and risk management solutions tailored for individual clients, not solutions replicated out of textbooks and manuals.
                    </p>
                <p>
<b>Our Service:</b> Unlike other consulting firms that latch on and linger indefinitely, our focus is to create value, maintain relationships, and retain clients.  If you don’t benefit from our services, fire us!  We would rather not be employed by your firm than to stick around not creating the value on which we focus.
                    </p>
                <p>
<b>Our Experience:</b> We understand Risk Management, Litigation and Cost Avoidance, and Crisis Management.  Our experience includes everything from contract claims and environmental disasters to accident prevention and uncontrolled project cost growth.  We are not fresh MBA graduates straight out of business school.  We are experienced industry experts with a broad background in the maritime industry.  We know what can make an organization successful and profitable, and what does not.
                    </p>
                <p>
<b>Our Commitment to Continuous Improvement: </b> As a firm, we are dedicated to reading, learning and personal growth to ensure that our clients have the best and most modern information available.  As time moves on and the world changes, we aim to remain current in our knowledge of the Maritime and Offshore Oil Industry and the issues that affect it. </p>
